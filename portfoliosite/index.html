  <h3>Why Codenation?</h3>
    <p>For a while I was not aware of the existance of these bootcamps. All I knew was self learning or a university course, which would take me years to complete. When thinking my direction in life, Code Nation was the first coding bootcamp that got me interested. With my previous experience in coding, I was confident that it would give me the ropes of not onlt coding, but working inside a team. Which that in turn would make me more ready for the industry.</p>

  <h3>My goals?</h3>
    <p>My dream is to corporate my intrests and hobbies into programming in some way. Music is my other passion in life, so working for a music related company would be awesome.This bootcamp serves as the perfect stepping stone into the tech industry.</p>
